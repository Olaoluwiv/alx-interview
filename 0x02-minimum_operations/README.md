# Minimum Operations Project

This project implements a function to calculate the minimum number of operations required to get exactly `n` characters 'H' in a text file using only two operations: Copy All and Paste.

## Files

- `0-minoperations.py`: Contains the implementation of the `min_operations` function.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## Function Prototype

```python
def min_operations(n):
    """
    Calculate the minimum number of operations required to get exactly n 'H'
    characters in the file.

    Parameters:
    n (int): The target number of 'H' characters.

    Returns:
    int: The fewest number of operations needed, or 0 if impossible.
